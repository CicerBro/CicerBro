## What's Up, Legends!

I'm **CicerBro**, the coding wizard, the legend of legends, the best thing since sliced bread! Inspired by the great Roman orator Cicero, but way cooler. Just like Cicero, I'm here to drop some serious wisdom, but in code. Here's the lowdown on me:

- **Pronouns:** Legend/Wizard 🧙‍♂️
- **Passions:** Crushing code, owning history, philosophizing life, casting spells, wooing the ladies like Casanova
- **Current Focus:** Building the most epic, jaw-dropping stuff ever

## Skills

- **Languages:** PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust
- **Frameworks:** Laravel, Node.js, Bun

## Epic Stats

## Wise Words

>"The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct." - **Cicero**

Feel the magic, embrace the legend. Explore my repos, drop an issue, or just bask in the awesomeness. Let’s make coding legendary!
